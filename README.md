# CoverLetterAdapter

This project is meant to make applying for jobs easier! I will be developing more features as I think of them and as I deem necessary, so I'll kee you all posted!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this project was meant to make applying for jobs a lot easier, and to create a script that makes adapting a cover letter to job applications easier! All you need to do is attach a file, let the script scrape the webpage for the information you'd like to add/replace for your cover letter, and Voila! the cover letter now contains the name of the position as well as the company!

As mentioned before, more capabilities and instructions will be added as the project develops.
